<h2>Javascript란 무엇인가</h2>

<P>
JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language 
that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] 
Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often 
incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated 
JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
